# ML Pipeline
This project utilize PySpark to analyze the PatientInfo dataset then perform some data preperation and preprocessing.
The next step is to create a machine learning pipeline using the logistic regression algorithm to perform a binary 
classification prediction on the data acheiving 87% accuracy.
